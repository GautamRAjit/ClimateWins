# ClimateWins

## Project Overview

ClimateWins wants to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe. Itâ€™s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the past 10 to 20 years. However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.

## Key Questions & Objectives

The following are the main questions that the company would like a data analyst to answer:

- How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
- Climate Wins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are
there any concerns specific to this project?
- Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on
a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)

## Tools Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3
